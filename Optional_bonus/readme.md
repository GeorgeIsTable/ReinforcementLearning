In this assignment, we construct DDQN to solve the optional problem and DDPG to solve the bonus problem

Please refer to the file option_hedging.ipynb for reference of the experiment.

Files 
  target_actor_ddpg,
  actor_ddpg, 
  critic_ddpg, 
  target_critic_ddpg, 
  policy_ddqn, 
  target_ddqn 

are only the checkpoint parameters of the best models
Files end with .pkl contain the trial results during evaluation
