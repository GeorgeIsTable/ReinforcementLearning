Aim: Apply Reinforcement Learning in the financial areas (e-trading/hedging/investment…)

Assignments

-   [x] Can we use the bandit algorithm to choose which stocks to investment？  (30pts) with HARD DDL on March 11.
    
-   [ ] In a binomial model of a single stock, suppose we can have only three possible actions, short 0, 0.5, 1.0 stocks, use Q-learning to train the optimal policy of hedging the stock. (30pts) with HARD DDL on April 15.
    
-   [ ] In a binomial model of a single stock, assume that we can hedge any fraction of a stock, use policy gradient to train the optimal policy of hedging an ATM European call option. Compare this to the delta hedging method under a binomial model. (40pts) with HARD DDL on May 13.
    
-   [ ] (Extra)As a substitute for Assignment 3, for the really advanced students: suppose the stock follows a GBM, construct an algorithm to train a NN that hedges an ATM European call option. 
    
-   [ ] (Extra)After solving the above optional question, use the DDPG algorithm in the TF agent to solve it again. Compare your results. You can use Google's co-lab for free GPU usage if you need it.
