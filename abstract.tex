\begin{document}
Over recent decades, we have seen multi-bandits algorithms is widely applied in modeling the explore-exploit tradeoff. Although we do not agree that this dilemma exists when one makes investing decision by the nature of the stock market, we would like to have experimental research on the backtesting result of MAB algorithms. The report begins by discussing the application of the multi-bandits algorithm on stock selection and compares them with other traditional investing strategies. It then further investigate the deficiency of the MAB algorithm and potential solution.
