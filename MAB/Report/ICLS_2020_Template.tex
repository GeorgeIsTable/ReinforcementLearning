\section{Acknowledgments}

This group assignment is completed by XU Guosong and CHEN Zuozhi with equal contribution. We had many times of video and face-to-face discussions about the whole idea. XU is responsible for collecting US market data, writing scripts for a part of MAB algorithms, and all the Momentum strategies. CHEN is responsible for collecting EU market data, modifying the rest of the MAB algorithms, and encapsulating them into a class. Then XU wrote the $\LaTeX$ code of this report while CHEN was running and checking the experiments parallelly.
Also, we would like to express our sincere appreciation to Professor Chak WONG and TAs because of their patient help.
